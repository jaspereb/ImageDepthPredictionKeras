# ImageDepthPredictionKeras
Currently under construction and does not work very well.


A Keras implementation of the supervised half of the monocular depth prediction network from "Semi-supervised Deep Learning for Monocular Depth Map Prediction". As of November 2018 this is the state of the art approach to depth map prediction from a single image. This repo only implements the supervised half of their network.
